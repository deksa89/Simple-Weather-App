Pogresive Web App - Simple Weather App 

This is a very simple Weather App. The goal wasn't to create good looking app, rather learn how to create progressive web app that stores cache and when there is no internet connection, it can show us what was the weather like last time we check it and had connection along with message "No internet connection" so that user is aware of that fact.
